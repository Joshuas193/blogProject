# blogProject

This is my first project for the Udacity Front-End Web develper Nano-Degree. I am creating a sample blog page with styling in CSS. All code was created by me although a lot of it required some research to help. Thanks go to Stack Overflow and W3Schools for all the help. There are only 2 working web pages but they are all repsonsive. The social media links for the band do work but the ones for my fictitious review ste do not since its just for a project. I learned quite a lot about CSS grid and how to properly size divs within the grid. I hope you enjoy the site.

Thanks,
Josh Swartzell
